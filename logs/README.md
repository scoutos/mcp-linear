# Logs Directory

This directory contains log files generated by the MCP Linear server.

## About

When using STDIO transport for MCP, standard output (`console.log`, etc.) cannot be used for logging as it would interfere with the MCP protocol messages. To solve this problem, the server redirects all logging to files in this directory instead.

## Log Files

- `mcp-linear.log` - Main log file containing runtime information, errors, and debugging details

## Log Format

Logs are written in a simple timestamp-prefixed format:

```
2025-04-07T16:28:45.160Z [INFO] Initializing MCP Linear server
2025-04-07T16:28:45.162Z [ERROR] Example error message
```

Each log entry contains:
- ISO timestamp
- Log level (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`)
- Message content

## Log Levels

The server uses the following log levels:

- `DEBUG` - Detailed debugging information (only in development mode)
- `INFO` - General information about server operation
- `WARN` - Warning conditions that should be addressed
- `ERROR` - Error conditions that may require attention

## Configure Logging

Log level can be controlled by setting the `NODE_ENV` environment variable:
- `NODE_ENV=development` - Includes DEBUG level logs
- Otherwise - Only INFO and above

## Viewing Logs

You can view logs using standard command-line tools:

```bash
# View the entire log file
cat logs/mcp-linear.log

# Follow log updates in real-time
tail -f logs/mcp-linear.log

# Search for errors
grep ERROR logs/mcp-linear.log
```

## Troubleshooting

If you're experiencing issues with the MCP Linear server, checking these logs can provide valuable information about what might be going wrong. The logs can help diagnose issues with:

1. Connection problems
2. Authentication errors
3. Linear API interactions
4. Tool execution errors

Since logs are written to files rather than stdout, they won't be visible in the terminal where you started the server, so remember to check this directory when troubleshooting.
