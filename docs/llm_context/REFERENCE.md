# Reference Documentation

This document contains references to documentation for specific technologies.

## Deno

It is **very important to remember that we are working on Deno 2.0**. You may know about lots of information specific to Deno 1.0, but it is important to check and see if we are doing things correctly for **Deno 2.0**.

You can find **up-to-date** documentation here: [Deno Docs](https://docs.deno.com)

## MCP (Model Context Protocol)

- [MCP Documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) - Official documentation for the Model Context Protocol

MCP Key Concepts:
- MCP is a standardized protocol for AI models to access external data and capabilities
- MCP servers expose specific capabilities through the standardized protocol
- Servers can connect to local data sources or remote services via web APIs
- The protocol provides a consistent interface for AI models to access different tools and data

## Linear

- [Linear API Documentation](https://developers.linear.app/docs) - Official Linear API documentation for integrating with Linear

- Linear provides a GraphQL API for programmatic access to issues, comments, and other data
- Authentication is typically done via API keys or OAuth
- The API allows searching, creating, reading, and updating issues and comments
