# LLM Context

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is where we keep documentation that is specifically meant for your
> consumption (as an LLM). Any time that you would typically write to something
> like `.CLAUDE.md` you should write to a document in this directory instead.
> Use your judgement and inspect the directory and file structure found within
> this directory to get a sense of how to organize your documentation. kl As you
> work, suggest and make updates to the documentation in this directory. This
> will help us to keep the documentation up to date and relevant to the work
> that we are doing.

## Contents

Inside this directory you will find the following:

- `CODE-STYLE.md`: describes our code preferences and the guidelines and
  approaches that you should follow
- `ACTIONS-AND-EFFECTS.md`: describes a particular architecture pattern that we
  use to structure our code
- `REFERENCE.md`: Contains reference information that you might need to refer to
  **READ THIS AT LEAST ONCE AND REMEMBER IT**
- `TASKS.md`: describes the types of tasks you might be asked to do. You should
  read this so you can compare requests and if a relevant request comes in,
  remember the context that was given to you here
- `WORKFLOW.md`: describes how you should work

Read all of these files at least once. They are all important and will help you
to understand how we work and what we expect from you.
